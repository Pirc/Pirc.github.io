## Welcome to the Pirc Platform&apos;s Brand Dictionary service.

This service was created in order to give the Pirc Platform an easy way to
discover what brands exist within an arbitrary hunk of text.

### Why you would use this service.

The Brand Dictionary service is useful for applications that need to parse
through unstructured chunks of text to find brand names.  This problem can 
be quite tricky to handle with a conventional parser or pattern matcher, not
only because there are literally thousands of consumer brands, but also becuase
they are not always spelled the same and sometimes contain multiple words.
The simplest example would be when looking at advertisements for sales on a 
retailers website.  Sales will typically have a title and a description, and
somewhere within that text there _may_ be one or many brand names.  
Since there really are no formatting rules for these things, finding brand 
names in thosetitles and descriptions programmatically can be quite difficult.
