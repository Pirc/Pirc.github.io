<h2 id="welcome_to_the_pirc_platforms_brand_dictionary_service">Welcome to the Pirc Platform&#39;s Brand Dictionary service.</h2>

<p>This service was created in order to give the Pirc Platform an easy way to discover what brands exist within an arbitrary hunk of text.</p>

<h3 id="why_you_would_use_this_service">Why you would use this service.</h3>

<p>The Brand Dictionary service is useful for applications that need to parse through unstructured chunks of text to find brand names. This problem can be quite tricky to handle with a conventional parser or pattern matcher, not only because there are literally thousands of consumer brands, but also becuase they are not always spelled the same and sometimes contain multiple words. The simplest example would be when looking at advertisements for sales on a retailers website. Sales will typically have a title and a description, and somewhere within that text there <em>may</em> be one or many brand names.<br />Since there really are no formatting rules for these things, finding brand names in thosetitles and descriptions programmatically can be quite difficult.</p>
